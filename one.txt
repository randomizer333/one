We belive that god or something created the universe by combining space and time
From the basic creation the primal energy emerged and force and the basic forces.
The circle of creation/destruction began

Strong and weak atomic force.
Electromagnetic force wich we call energy
Gravity
Information

From energy matter was/is created. 
Then the seed has emerged, on distant worlds till the
the seed of life that fell to earth about 4 bilion years ago scientist say.
From that seed all of the gods children were created with a purpose of creation not destruction.
